# ProofCore Changelog

All notable changes to ProofCore are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-06

### Added
- Introduced the Research Benchmark Module (RBM) foundation: loader/parser, cascade validator, metrics helpers, and CLI reporting (`rbm_cli`) with a sample dataset.
- Added Python smoke tests under `backend/tests_rbm/` covering CA proof hooks, cascade evaluation, metrics, and CLI execution.
- Replaced vendored Pyodide assets with a manifest-driven fetch/verify pipeline (`npm run setup:pyodide`, `npm run verify:offline-assets`).

### In Progress
- Extend the manifest workflow with Subresource Integrity hashes and automated dependency scanning (npm audit / pip-audit / OSV).
- Implement Service Worker caching and true lazy loading so Pyodide assets download only when offline features are invoked.

---

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-24

### [*] Complete Optimization & Offline-First Certification Release

**ProofCore v1.0.2** delivers production-ready optimization across performance, design system, testing, and offline guarantees with comprehensive live demo for Hugging Face Spaces.

#### Maintenance (2025-11-04)

- **Offline Mode Hardening**
  - Frontend now defaults to `VITE_OFFLINE_MODE=true` with guarded fallback to bundled verification weights.
  - All API clients route through `safeFetch`, enforcing the offline firewall unless `VITE_ALLOW_NETWORK=true`.
  - Backend gains explicit `OFFLINE_MODE` / `ENABLE_LLM_PROVIDERS` toggles; LLM adapters short-circuit when operating offline.
  - Offline tests exercise the real network guard instead of relying on mocks.
- **Pyodide Bundling**
  - Added `pyodide` dependency declaration and `npm run verify:offline-assets` script to validate vendored WASM assets.
  - Documented manual vendoring steps plus placeholder `public/pyodide/README.md`.
- **Security & Dependency Hygiene**
  - Updated Vite 5.4.x, esbuild 0.25.x, MSW stack (`@mswjs/data` 0.16.x, `msw` 2.4.x) to remove known advisories.
  - Remaining advisories require Vite/Vitest major upgrades and are tracked for a future release.
- **Documentation & Versioning**
  - `.env.example`, backend configuration, README, and packaging metadata now consistently reflect v1.0.2.
  - CHANGELOG and release notes point to the offline-first maintenance scope.
- **Research Benchmark Module (RBM)**
  - Introduced `proofcore/research_benchmark` with computer-assisted proof hooks, cascade validator, and metrics helpers.
  - Added `rbm_cli` reporting utility and sample dataset `data_examples/sample_set.json` for smoke tests.
  - Python smoke tests under `backend/tests_rbm` cover hooks, metrics, and CLI integration.

#### Fixed

##### Configuration Drift (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: Backend and frontend had separate, hardcoded configuration values
- **Solution**: Created backend config API endpoint as single source of truth
- **Impact**: Configuration changes now propagate automatically to frontend

##### Conceptual Drift (HIGH PRIORITY)
