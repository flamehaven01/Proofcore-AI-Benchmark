# Pyodide Assets (Generated)

This directory is populated at build or deployment time by running:

```bash
npm run setup:pyodide
```

The command reads `pyodide-manifest.json`, downloads the listed files,
and verifies their hashes before writing them here. The directory is
kept empty in git to prevent vendoring large binary artifacts.
